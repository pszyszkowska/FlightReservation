This is my first Python project, created in the Django framework. 
This is a website for booking flights. 
The website has functions such as: 
-registration, 
-login, 
-ability to book flights, 
-user authorization for booking, 
-additional tabs such as About, Contact, etc.

Please start project with python manage.py runserver --insecure
